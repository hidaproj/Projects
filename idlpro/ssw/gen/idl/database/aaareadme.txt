			      DATABASE Utilities

			  Last updated: 15 June 1994


This subdirectory contains the IDL procedures, mostly written by Don Lindler,
to create and access a database.    These database procedures are used by
both the UIT and HRS science teams.  The LaTex file DATABASE.TEX describes
the use of the database procedures, with an emphasis on astronomical
applications. 

The database procedures require the non-standard system variables
!PRIV, !TEXTOUT, and !TEXTUNIT.   These can be added to the IDL session 
using the procedure ASTROLIB.

On 1-Nov-1991 the database procedures were modified to expect item data
types to be recorded with the current IDL Version 2 codes, rather than
the old Version 1 codes.   In addition, the .dbc file has been renamed
to a .dbh file.   This means that databases created prior to 1-Nov-1991
must be updated with DBCREATE to work with the current software. 
Below is a sample program which can be used to update all the databases in a 
directory.

pro fixdb
!PRIV =2 
a = findfile('*.dbf')                 ;Find all databases
for i=0,N_elements(a)-1 do begin      ;Loop over all databases
   fdecomp,a(i),disk,dir,name         ;Decompose database name
   dbcreate,name                      ;Create .DBH file
endfor
return
end
   
The existing .dbc files can be deleted unless one is also using IDL V1
software on the same databases.

One difference between this software and the version found in the Astronomy
User's Library, is that external data representation is now supported.  See the
routine DBCREATE for details.  It is expected that these same modifications
will also be incorporated in the Astronomy User's Library in the near future.
